GameOfLife
==========

This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game Of Life in Javascript. I use a table to make it visible. So it's rather slow.


###Features

Options are:
 -  Grid size
 -  Interval Time
 -  Startpopulation
 

###What doesn't work well
 -  You only see what you have drawn after releasing the mouse
 -  MouseUp, MouseDown don't always fire properly
